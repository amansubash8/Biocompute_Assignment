# BioCompute ML Assignment: 1D Signal Classification

This repository contains the full implementation for the **BioCompute Machine Learning Engineer Assignment**, including data exploration, synthetic dataset creation, signal preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.  
The main goal of the project was to **adapt the DeepSignal model for 1D nanopore signal classification** and then design an improved architecture for higher accuracy.

## Project Overview

### Objective
To classify 1D nanopore signals by adapting the DeepSignal architecture and improving it using a deeper hybrid neural network.

### Key Decisions
The provided `.pod5` data (control_rep2.pod5) contains **raw nanopore signal** but **no methylation labels**.  
Generating such labels would require a full bioinformatics pipeline (dorado + modkit), which is outside this assignment’s scope.  

To meet requirements, a **hybrid "toy" dataset** was created:
- Real biological noise from control_rep2.pod5  
- Synthetic randomized spike added for binary classification  
- High-noise environment to mimic real challenges  

---

## Project Pipeline

### 1. Data Exploration  
Notebook: **1_Data_Exploration.ipynb**  
The `.pod5` file was inspected to validate its structure and understand the raw signal distribution.  
Conclusion: labels are not present; synthetic labels must be created.

### 2. Dataset Creation & Preprocessing  
Two datasets were generated:

#### ultra (recommended)
- Smoothed using a **Gaussian filter (sigma = 0.8)**  
- Better signal-to-noise ratio  
- Used for final high-accuracy experiments  
- Generated by: **2_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb**

#### adv (no smoothing)
- Retains high-frequency noise  
- More challenging for the models  
- Generated by: **2_Data_Preprocessing_without_gaussian.ipynb**

Both preprocessing pipelines output:
- `X_train_*.npy`
- `y_train_*.npy`
- `X_test_*.npy`
- `y_test_*.npy`

## 3. Baseline Model  
Notebook: **3_Model_Baseline.ipynb**

A simplified adaptation of the DeepSignal hybrid architecture:
- Parallel **CNN + Bi-LSTM** branches  
- Merged dense layers  
- Served as the baseline for comparison

---

## 4. Improved Model  
Notebook: **4_Model_Improved.ipynb**

A deeper **serial hybrid model**:
- Two stacked CNN layers  
- Followed by a Bi-LSTM  
- Includes BatchNormalization and Dropout  
- Designed for more stable feature extraction and better generalization

This model achieves **≈99% accuracy** on the smoothed dataset.

## 5. Evaluation  
Notebook: **5_Evaluation_Report.ipynb**

Generates:
- ROC curves for both models  
- Confusion matrices  
- Accuracy/F1/Precision/Recall comparison charts  

Models used:
- `baseline_model.keras`
- `improved_model_ultra.keras`
